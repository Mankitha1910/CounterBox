CounterBox

CounterBox is a simple and interactive counter application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to increase and decrease a counter value using + and - buttons, with a smooth and modern UI.

🚀 Features

Increment & Decrement Buttons – Click + to increase and - to decrease the counter.

Default “ADD” Display – Before the counter starts, it shows "ADD" instead of 0.

Stylish UI – Designed with a gradient effect, rounded corners, and responsive layout.

Validation – Prevents the counter from going below "ADD".

⚙️ How It Works

The + button calls the increase() function → increments the counter.

The - button calls the decrease() function → decrements the counter but never goes below "ADD".

The current value is dynamically displayed inside the counter box.
